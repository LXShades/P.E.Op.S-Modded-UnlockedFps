How to compile the MesaGL plugin:

- open a terminal window in the "src_plugin" folder, and type "make" + ENTER

How to compile the plugin configuration tool:

- extract the "gpucfg.tar.gz" archive from the "src_linux_cfg" folder, go 
  to the "gpucfg\src" folder and type "make" + ENTER. Maybe some special libraries
  are needed though, the config tool is done with a very old version of GLADE.
  If you want to make a newer tool, go ahead... the major work of the tool is
  done in "main.c", this file is easy to adapt to other GUI libraries, imho.

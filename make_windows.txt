How to compile the Windows plugin:

- for easy going, you will need at least a Visual Studio Version 6.0. Newer VS versions 
  can easiliy convert the project file, I've compiled the release binaries with VS 2005.
  
  That's all. No NASM, no special libraries, no nothing (well, gl.h _is_ needed ;))
